## Introduction
An analysis of 'getembed's user interface will attempt to yield a series of improvements
that can be made. The focus of these improvements will be:
  * making the site more visually pleasing
  * making the site more intuitive to use and navigate
  * drawing out the key information points and highlighting them

### Questions and Assumptions
Without a principle understanding of the 'getembed' site, there are some immediate
questions that would usually have been asked. In absence of the answers, some assumptions
will be made and the recommended improvements will be based upon them.

#### Questions
  * Who is the primary user of the site?
    * What is their story?
    * Which information is most important to them?
  * Is there a primary form-factor or device?
    * Will this be predominantly accessed on mobile? Desktop? Kiosk?
    * If there is a primary device, are there bandwidth constraints?
  * What is the skill-level of the average site user?
    * Do we expect tech-savvy, or complete-novice, or average ability?

As an example of why there might be a difference, knowing the motives behind the
primary user of 'getembed' sie allows us to prioritise the information that is displayed
and the way in which it is presented. In any situation where the answers to these
questions are unavailable, assumptions must be made.

### Assumptions
The following assumptions have been made regarding the intended user and form-factor.
  * The site is predominantly viewed on desktop computers/laptops.
    * For now, there will be no recommendations for a mobile experience.
  * The site user is of average-ability, but with a high-level understanding of the data
  being presented by the site, such as sensor readings and what impact they have.
  * Possibly a civil servant, but some one who understands the building trade enough
    that the data doesn't need 'dumbing down' too much.
    * They will use 'getembed' in an investigatory manner, i.e. to locate and find 
    information on a single property within a project and programme.

## Analysis
The analysis will focus on the 'Main' part of the site, omitting the 'Compare' and
'Property Map' sections, for now.
### Equipment
The analysis was performed with the following equipment:
  * **Device** Laptop
  * **OS** Windows 8.1
  * **Resolution** 3840x2160
  * **Browser** Chrome 43

### First Impressions

The current site is bereft of any styling, other than a a vanilla Bootstrap theme. It
appears flat and unbalanced. Its clear that it is presenting information regarding a 
single property - this is made obvious by the titling and overview fields. There is a
picture of the property but without visual anchors it looks quite 'floaty' on the right
side of the page. There are icons used to indicate 'Technologies', however there is no
visible key, no ALT attribute for the icons and they are unfamiliar enough to be mostly
confusing rather than informative.
